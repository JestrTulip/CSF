Assignment 2: Milestone 1

Dayann D'almeida: dkouako1
Kedar Krishnan: kkrish13

For Milestone 1, Kedar implemented the draw functions, as well as the blend colors, blend 
components, square_dist and set_pixel functions. His implementation of draw pixel also
checks for proper bounds. Dayann worked on the functions needed to obtain the colors with a 
mask, as well as the function to blend colors and worked on fixing the errors. 
EDIT 9/29/2022: Added uint tests for in_bounds, compute_index and all get functions, as well as 
clamp. Did not include tests for set_pixel and blend_components, since they are downstream &
upstream of heavily test functions. 

For Milestone 2: Kedar worked on in_bounds, compute_index, set_pixel and draw_pixel. 
Dayann worked on all the gets and the blend_components function.
